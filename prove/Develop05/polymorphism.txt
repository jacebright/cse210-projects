Polymorphism is the concept of adaptability. A method from a base class can be 
made to be changed by each of the derived classes and have different
functionality in each one while having the same name. A benefit of Polymorphism
is while having a list of objects derived from the same base class, one could 
loop through the list and call the same method, but it will perform a unique 
action for each object type. An example from my code this week is when I
utilized a list of goals (of different types) and looped through each one to 
display the details. Two of the three classes had the same functionality, but
the method was overridden for the third class, allowing it to be called by the
same name, but show different details.
foreach (Goal goal in _goals)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{count}. {goal.GetDetailsString()}");
            count +=1;
        }
